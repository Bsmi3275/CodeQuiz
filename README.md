### License:
#### <p>Apache</p>

### Description: 
#### <p>The purpose of this project is to create a quiz with 10 questions relevant to Coding. I did this in "true and false" standards. At the end, you can enter your initials (the homework instructions did not specify an actual scoreboard). </p>

### Contributing:
#### <p>Benjamin Smith</p>

### Usage: 
#### <p>The object of this app that I created is to keep answering the questions, enter your information, and see your final score. This displays the height of javascript's utility.</p>

#### <p>I also tried to change and/or simplify the time, disappear, and button elements in script.js page to see what works. I try to stay true to the other code that I have put together for other class assignments. Here is a 'time' example.</p>

#### <p>As you can see my attempts failed. This was until I..</p>
* Broke apart each element/variable
* Split question option/answer possibilities into functions. (This is where true/false comes in handy). This is unlike what I was used to in previous assignments, interpreting separate pages categorically as HTML pages (as seen in the Coding Snippet and the justgetsworse gif). I get around this by assigning different values per function to populate the div id. Something that I first thought impossible during the first three assignments and first Project.
* I start with questions, answers, answer results to inform the test taker of their progress, and finally use the script.js page to assign a sequence. After this, there is the end page.
* The lesson I learned: Easy is Better! I have never valued this until encountering this assignment. 

#### <p>Here is a final gif of the successful app</p>

#### <p>Afterwards, I changed the initials to a table. Here is my first attempt</p>

#### <p>and a final working attempt.</p>

![ChangedNameAndWorkingTable](assets/ChangedNameAndWorkingTable.PNG)

#### <p>These final parts were added for appearance's sake. This was way overdue, but I am glad that I completed it when I did because doing so helped me with another assignment as well as my project. This is one of those instances which luck, divine intervention, or perhaps just a notably positive coincidence takes place. I did not, however, successfully get to save anything to the local storage. That is addressed in the next assignment, #5. </p>

#### <p>This project was by far the hardest I have ever completed and has taken me months to fully master. The first attempt is shown sideways on the following image.</p>
